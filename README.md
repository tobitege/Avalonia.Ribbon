# AvaloniaRibbon

This is a Ribbon Control Component library that replicates Microsoft's Ribbon UI, as seen in Windows 8+'s File Explorer,
Microsoft Office 2007+, and in various other places, for Avalonia. In its present state, it is reasonably usable, but
some features are still missing, so it should not considered complete.

## Project Background

The original project was developed by [amazerol](https://github.com/amazerol/AvaloniaRibbon) and was then optimized
by [Splitwirez](https://github.com/Splitwirez/AvaloniaRibbon). Once the Avalonia 11 was released it was then ported to
11.0.1 by [NOoBODDY](https://github.com/NOoBODDY/AvaloniaRibbon).
The original version of the component is used in **[Jaya File Manager](https://github.com/JayaFM/Jaya)**, but other
projects are welcome to use it as well.

## Cross-Platform Support

Given that Avalonia is a cross-platform UI framework and to support the availability, currently, this project is being
optimized by [Sachith Liyanagama](https://github.com/SachiHarshitha/Avalonia.Ribbon).
The overall controls library is refactored as follows.

|          Project          | Usecase             |
|:-------------------------:|---------------------|
|     AvaloniaUI.Ribbon     | Desktop, WASM, etc. |
| AvaloniaUI.Ribbon.Desktop | Desktop Only        |

## Available Controls

In order to support
the [ControlTheme](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/basics/user-interface/styling/control-themes) architecture, the
controls are currently being either optimized or re-developed if necessary.
Based on the platform availability the components are summarized as follows.

## How to Use

1. Refer the package according to your usecase as mentioned in above **Cross-Platform Support** Section.

2. Include ribbon styles to App.xaml as shown below.

   Default theme:
    ```xaml
        <StyleInclude Source="avares://AvaloniaUI.Ribbon/Styles/Fluent/AvaloniaRibbon.xaml" />
    ```
   
   "DESKTOP" theme:
    ```xaml
        <StyleInclude Source="avares://AvaloniaUI.Ribbon.Desktop/Styles/Default/AvaloniaRibbon.xaml" />
    ```
   
   and localized text (same for both themes):
    ```xaml
        <ResourceInclude Source="avares://AvaloniaUI.Ribbon/Locale/en-ca.xaml" />
    ```

    3. Use the below mentioned sample as an example to use the ribbon control.
       The sample is available in the [AvaloniaUI.Ribbon.Demo]() project.
       ```xaml
               <Ribbon Name="RibbonControl" DockPanel.Dock="Top" Orientation="Horizontal" HelpButtonCommand="{Binding HelpCommand}">
                   <RibbonMenu
                   Width="50"
                   KeyTip.KeyTipKeys="F">
                      <RibbonMenuItem Header="New" Group="File" IsTopDocked="True">

                                  Fill="Red" />
                          </RibbonMenuItem.Icon>
                          <RibbonMenuItem.Content></RibbonMenuItem.Content>

# Avalonia Ribbon

Please acknowledge Splitwirez for all the last new features added to the ribbon. As far as I'm concerned, I'm just
centralizing code and updating the nuget.

You can also acknowledge Rubal Walia as well for cleaning up all my messy code.
